# Quick Notes

- Data and databases in hospitals are important, because they allow specialists to improve the system.
  "Effective database management enables healthcare providers to make informed decisions, improve patient care,
  and optimize hospital operations." [1]
- Hospitals work with lots of data. Without it, they can not know critical details about their patients, information
  about its doctors and employees, about inventory and taxes and history about everything that happened. This is
  the reason why databases are part of a hospital as well. History of medical data and events is essential for
  any hospital of any size. Hospitals need to store data such as patients records, inventory and financial and
  administrative data. [1]
