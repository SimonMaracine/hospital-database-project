# Quick Notes

- Data and databases in hospitals are important, because they allow specialists to improve the system.
  "Effective database management enables healthcare providers to make informed decisions, improve patient care,
  and optimize hospital operations." [1]
- Hospitals work with lots of data. Without it, they can not know critical details about their patients, information
  about its doctors and employees, about inventory and taxes and history about everything that happened. This is
  the reason why databases are part of a hospital as well. History of medical data and events is essential for
  any hospital of any size. Hospitals need to store data such as patients records, inventory and financial and
  administrative data. They may also collect and store quality data and metrics, which may be used for improvement. [1]
- An another important aspect about hospital data is its confidentiality. Hospitals store a great amount of personal,
  but necessary information about their patients and that data needs to remain confidential and needs to be protected.
  "Encrypting sensitive patient data at rest and in transit is vital for preventing unauthorized access.
  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are commonly used to encrypt data
  transmitted between systems. Additionally, encrypting data stored in the database itself adds an extra layer
  of protection against data breaches." [1]

- While databases definetly help optimize the process of providing health-care for institutions such as hospitals,
  they are no without flaws. Some of the main ones are: [2]
  - the large amount of raw data can increase the workload of the user
  - technical problems can occur during the process of storing this large amount of data
  - potential attacks on the database through hacking and other methods can lead to security and privacy issues
  - storing inaccurate information can sometimes occur due to the instantaneous nature of databases, if they are not
    made properly
