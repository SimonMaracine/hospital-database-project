# Quick Notes

- Data and databases in hospitals are important, because they allow specialists to improve the system.
  "Effective database management enables healthcare providers to make informed decisions, improve patient care,
  and optimize hospital operations." [1]
- Hospitals work with lots of data. Without it, they can not know critical details about their patients, information
  about its doctors and employees, about inventory and taxes and history about everything that happened. This is
  the reason why databases are part of a hospital as well. History of medical data and events is essential for
  any hospital of any size. Hospitals need to store data such as patients records, inventory and financial and
  administrative data. They may also collect and store quality data and metrics, which may be used for improvement. [1]
- Another important aspect about hospital data is its confidentiality. Hospitals store a great amount of personal,
  but necessary information about their patients and that data needs to remain confidential and needs to be protected.
  "Encrypting sensitive patient data at rest and in transit is vital for preventing unauthorized access.
  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are commonly used to encrypt data
  transmitted between systems. Additionally, encrypting data stored in the database itself adds an extra layer
  of protection against data breaches." [1]

- While databases definetly help optimize the process of providing health-care for institutions such as hospitals,
  they are no without flaws. Some of the main ones are: [2]
  - the large amount of raw data can increase the workload of the user
  - technical problems can occur during the process of storing this large amount of data
  - potential attacks on the database through hacking and other methods can lead to security and privacy issues
  - storing inaccurate information can sometimes occur due to the instantaneous nature of databases, if they are not
    made properly

- Besides helping medical proffesionals in ther day to day work, databases in health-care institutions can promote: [3]

  - Efficiency. The data that comes from all the people that vist a hospital every day must be reported in detail for it to be properly used in a healthcare database. Afterwards in order for said data to be recorded properly, the database must be well-designed and simple to use, containing all of the necessary in-depth information required, while avoiding any unnecesarry information that doesn't serve a purpose in the workflow of the instituion.

  - Information Exchanges. Patients may require services that span multiple healthcare providers, as such databases from different healthcare platforms must be able to quickly send the necessary information between each without any variation, promoting cooperation between these healthcare providers.

  - Healthcare Quality Assessment. By using data from verious sources like hospitals, health departments, state and regional agencies etc., experts can more easily deduce things such as the availability, affordability, innovation and barriers to seeking healthcare of instituions in a certain region and maybe compare it with that of other regions, which can in turn lead to improvements to these things if problems are noticed.

  - Tracking and Monitoring. By using the data stored in this kind of a database healthcare providers can monitor health care services and improve the quality of patient care—by gaining statistics on costs, pervasive diseases, and appropriate treatments, while medical staff can more easily provide patients with confident, efficient treatments. On top of that other healthcare institutions could safely access this information for health planning, reforms, and decision-making purposes.

- In short, databases in healthcare improve interactions between patients and their providers. Healthcare databases assist with diagnosis and treatment, manage documentation and billing, and help reduce errors in medical operations and management. Because they limit paperwork and staff, databases in healthcare reduce medical facility running costs while improving performance.

- A hospital management system is made up of multiple componenets which make up a robust and efficient system, but their number might change depending on the specific needs of each clinic. While our project might not include all of these, here are some of the basic components that are usually included in such a system for the record. [4]

  - Patient management. It is used to control patient flow. It can be used to register them, get the data of the patients’ health condition, view the treatment and check the medical history and reports.

  - Appointment module. Deals with arranging the schedule of doctors according to the patients’ application, which helps to organize the availability of medical specialists according to the needs of the patients.

  - Facility management. The facility management module is responsible for tracking and maintaining the room availability, the occupancy status as well as various kinds of administrative documentation.

  - Inventory management. Controls the clinic's inventory and helps automate the entire supply chain for the convenience of the staff.

  - Accounting. Helps organize the financial affairs of both customers and the medical institution.

  - Medicine management. Contains all the usual medicines used for the specific treatments and also keeps records of a patient’s medicines used for their specific treatment.

  - Laboratory and tests management. Manages all the test and lab results, which can be viewed by the staff and used for the patients’ reports.

  - Reporting. Stores the already processed information, which helps management collect, analyze and view the performance data in a comprehensive format.

- Hospital databases should be tailored to their specific needs. Not every hospital or heatlthcare organization is
  the same. This means that things like:
  - data integration for connectivity with other systems,
  - interoperability with various healthcare systems,
  - analytics tools and
  - user interfaces
  differ from organization to organization. We make our database tailored to a very small and basic hospital that
  doesn't do much research or analytics and that doesn't need a very complex or intricate system. [5]
